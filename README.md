Recruiting for FFL
Searching for a better way is the core human trait. Some people are happy with their careers, but wonder "Could it be better?" Others are really in a tough spot. They are not happy with the work they are doing- but lack the financial resource to make a change. The remain stuck. One year, and the next, etc. We all want to try somenting different. My collegues and I at FFL all started partime. 5 hours a week to find out if FFL is a place we can plant our flag- while keeping our flag waving at our current job.
